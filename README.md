## 🤔 How to use it

Click an available timeslot above and submit the GitHub issue generated. Wait a little while and hopefully get confirmation your timeslot has been booked.

## 👷 How it works

On opening or reopening an issue a GitHub Actions workflow is [triggered](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#issues-event-issues). This reads the contents of the issue, checks the bookings in `bookings.json`, and if the slot is valid and available updates `bookings.json` and `README.md`. The links in the table use the GitHub automation [query parameters](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-automation-for-issues-and-pull-requests-with-query-parameters#supported-query-parameters) to fill out the important things in the issue.
